# Introduction to R

# What is R?
### A free, open source, powerful software for handling large datasets and complex or custom data mining projects.
### Who uses R?
### Google, AT&T, US Department of Defense, many large organizations.
### How do we use R?
### Command line interface: Powerful and flexible.
### RStudio: Nicer interface; still requires coding.
### Rattle: Point-and-click interface for R; good for simple analysis but not for complex analysis.
### What other software are available:
### Vendor specific tools (SAS Enterprise Miner): Once very popular, now losing market to R.


###  Download from CRAN’s website: http://cran.r-project.org.
###    -Available in Microsoft 32 and 64-bit Windows, Mac OS-X, and Linux versions.
###    -Also download Rstudio from https://www.rstudio.com; this is an IDE for R.
###    -From time to time, we will need additional packages in class; we will install them as we go along.
### How to get help with R:
###   -Easiest: Google search including the capital letter “R”.
###     -E.g. “importing csv files in R”.
###   -Hardest: Search on CRAN (http://cran.us.r-project.org/).
###   -Most convenient: If you know an R function but don’t know exactly how to use it, you can pull-up help from the command line by typing “?” followed by the function name
###       -E.g. “?read.csv” will display the complete syntax and explanation of the read.csv function.
